- [ ] I built a simple table with `caption`, `th`, `td`
- [ ] I created a form with text, email, password, and submit inputs
- [ ] I used labels correctly and associated them to inputs with `for`/`id`

## Stage 2 — CSS Basics
- [ ] I linked `style.css` in `<head>` using `<link>`
- [ ] I changed typography (font, size, line-height) for body and headings
- [ ] I used colors (text, backgrounds) and tested contrast
- [ ] I demonstrated box model (margin, padding, border)
