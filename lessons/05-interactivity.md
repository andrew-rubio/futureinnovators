# Lesson 05 â€” Interactivity

**Goal:** Build interactive UI components with JS (carousel, hamburger, dynamic content).

## Tasks
1. **Carousel**: Cycle through a list of images or cards every few seconds and with Next/Prev buttons.
2. **Hamburger**: Implement a mobile menu toggle with `aria-expanded` updates.
3. **Dynamic List**: Add new items to a list from a text input.

## Success Criteria
- Components are keyboard-friendly and announce state changes where appropriate.
- Code is structured with small functions.

## Example Snippets (optional)
See `snippets/05-interactivity.js` (and reuse HTML/CSS from earlier lessons).
