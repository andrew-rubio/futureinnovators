# Lesson 04 â€” JavaScript Basics

**Goal:** Learn what JavaScript is and how to use it to make your website interactive.

## Tasks
1. In `script.js`, use `console.log()` to print a welcome message to the console.
3. Use JavaScript to show the current year in the footer (hint: use `getElementById` and `new Date().getFullYear()`).
4. Use `getElementById` or `querySelector` to select an element on your page and change its text or color with JavaScript.
5. In your Projects section, add a new button. Use JavaScript to make something happen when you click it (for example, change the background color of the page or print a message to the console).
6. Make sure the contact form does not submit if any field is empty. Show a message if the user tries to submit without filling everything in.

## Success Criteria
- The JavaScript file is linked and runs without errors.
- You can see your welcome message in the browser console.
- The year in the footer updates automatically.
- You can change text or color on the page with JavaScript.
- Clicking a button changes something on the page.
- The form shows a message if required fields are empty.
