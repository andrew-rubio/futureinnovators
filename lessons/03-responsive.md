# Lesson 03 â€” Responsive Design Basics

**Goal:** Learn how to make your website look good on both computers and phones (responsive design).

## Tasks
1. Set a maximum width for your main content so it doesn't stretch too wide on big screens.
2. Add some space (margin or padding) around your main content so it doesn't touch the edges of the screen.
3. Add a media query in your CSS so that when the screen is small (like on a phone), the text size and padding get a bit smaller.
4. Make sure your navigation links stack vertically (one on top of the other) when the screen is small.
5. Try resizing your browser window to see your changes!

## Success Criteria
- The main content is not too wide on big screens.
- There is space around the content.
- The text and layout adjust for small screens.
- The navigation is easy to use on both big and small screens.
